# Basic Math and Personalized Greeting Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

1. **Basic Mathematical Operations**: Performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-provided numbers.
2. **Personalized Greeting**: Takes the user's first and last name and prints a personalized greeting message.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <repository-name>
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Program Descriptions

### Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
- Takes two numbers as input.
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Displays the results of each operation.

### Task 2: Personalized Greeting
- Takes the user's first and last name as input.
- Concatenates the names to form a full name.
- Prints a personalized greeting message.

## Example Output
```
Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Results:
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0

Task 2: Personalized Greeting
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
