# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

input1 = input("first number:")
input2 =input("second number:")
addition = int(input1) + int(input2)
Subtraction = int(input1) - int(input2)
Multiplication = int(input1) * int(input2)
Division =int(input1)/int(input2)
print("addition:", addition)
print("subtraction:", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication",Multiplication)
print("Division",Division)
